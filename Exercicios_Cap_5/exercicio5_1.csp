--Exercise 5.1 Specify that a liftâ€™s doors should not be open when the lift starts moving.
--Assume that it has events open, close, moving, stopped in its alphabet.

datatype ACT = open | close

channel door: ACT
channel moving, stopped

DOORS = door.open -> door.close -> DOORS

LIFT = door.open -> door.close -> moving -> stopped -> LIFT

CONTROL = DOORS [{|door|} || {|door,moving,stopped|}] LIFT
