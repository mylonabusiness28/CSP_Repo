-- Exercise 2.7 Consider the hypercube network of Example 2.13.

--1. Not all of the channel names in Figure 2.6 have been given their subscripts. Give the subscripts for the remaining channels.

channel in, out :{0..N}
channel c :{0..N}.{0..N}

 = 2

NODE(l) = in.?l -> out.?l -> (c.?l.?d) 

ALPHA_N = {}

adj(l) = 

next(l,d) = 

MAILER = || l:{0..1} @ [ALPHA_N] l -> NODE(l)
